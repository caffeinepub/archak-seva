The file summaries confirm the new ARCHAK wordmark logo is used in both components. However, the actual binary image file (logo.dim_300x120.png) does not appear in the diff as an added file, which is the primary gap.",

      "reason": "The diff shows no added files. The image file frontend/public/assets/generated/logo.dim_300x120.png does not appear in the 'ADDED FILES' section, meaning the actual logo asset was not committed or is not reflected in the diff. The src references in Navigation.tsx and Footer.tsx point to this path, but the file itself is not shown as added.",
